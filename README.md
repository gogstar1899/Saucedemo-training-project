# Saucedemo test automation training project
This is my training automation project.
Main goal is to practice Ruby, Rspec, Selenium and Capybara.


# Description
This repository contains test plan, test scenarios, test cases and  basic automation test scrips for main funcionality of fake web-store application created for practicing automation.
I am using selenium-webdriver because it is the most popular open-source automated testing framework used to validate web applications across different browsers and platforms, also I am using Rspec to write my tests.
My aim is to learn the basics of creating project from scratch, trying to implement good practices like - don't repeat yourself, code reusability, practicing creating of project sceleton, creating separate file for test data, implementing page object model. Learn how to use code style checkers like rubocop gem and debugging tool like pry.
